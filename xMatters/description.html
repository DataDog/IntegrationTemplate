      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>xMatters IT Alerting integrates people into your toolchains spanning DevOps, Ops, and Service Management solutions. xMatters automates communications so you can proactively prevent outages, rapidly engage resolvers, manage major incidents, and keep stakeholders informed.</p>

      <p>DataDog alerts trigger xMatters notifications with responses integrated into all your IT tools, replacing manual steps in your incident management process:
        <ul>
          <li>Notify resolvers based on escalation rules, on-call schedules, skills, and location</li>
          <li>Look up the current xMatters on-call schedule from DataDog collaboration environment</li>
          <li>Allow stakeholders to manage subscription and notification preferences for proactive communications during service disruptions</li>
          <li>Enrich notifications with information from other tools in your IT toolchain to provide actionable content and increase resolver efficiency</li>
          <li>Configure response options that trigger other xMatters integrations and drive workflow for tasks such as creating tickets, updating consoles, sending additional notifications, and initiating chat & conference-call collaboration</li>
          <li>Use the xMatters mobile app to quickly look up who's on call, receive & respond to notifications, and engage other teams to minimize time to resolve service disruptions</li>
          <li>Continuously improve your operational processes with reporting & analytics</li>
        </ul>
      With over 200 integrations across a wide range of IT tools, xMatters is used by individual teams for day-to-day tasks, and across thousands of teams at Global 2000 companies working together at enterprise scale.</p>
