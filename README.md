# Datadog Integration Tile Template

Tiles add a measure of professonalism and polish to your Integration. This makes it easier for other to find, trust, and benefit from your contribution.

## Automatic Template Generation

The process of generating a tile template for your Integration is now automated via [Cookiecutter][1]. See the [Create a New Integration][2] document for more information on how to generate the template and correctly fill out the resulting files.
