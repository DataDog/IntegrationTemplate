## Overview

Collect custom metrics from your application with a few clicks and send it to DataDog. No need to write code, redeploy or restart your app. [Start a free trial](https://www.rookout.com/join-our-early-adopters-plan/).
* Enhance monitoring and expedite production debugging with Rookout’s on-demand data collection. 
* Have a new custom metric but you didn’t create the instrumentation to collect it? Not a problem. Rookout can collect custom metrics ad-hoc.

## Setup
### Installation
Rookout sends data to Datadog via the DogstatsD service available from the Datadog agent.

1. Install the [Datadog agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/).

2. Add the `dogstatsd` target to your rule. [See full documentation](https://docs.rookout.com).

## Data Collected
You can create metrics and events by creating a Datadog output in your Rookout rule.
